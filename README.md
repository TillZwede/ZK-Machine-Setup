Setup for ZK-Machines

1. Install Linux (this guide was created on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system)
2. Install Updates (Linux Updater should pop up a few minutes after installation of the system)
3. (Useful for VMs: Install some sort of guest additions)
4. Look into the setup.sh script and see which parts you need/want (use comments on the parts you do not need)
5. run the setup.sh script
